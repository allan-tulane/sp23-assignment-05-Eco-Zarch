- **1a.**

The Greedy Algorithm would start by finding the largest base 2 number less than n, this number would be the first coin. Then the algorithm would find the largest base 2 number less than the difference between n and value of the previous coin(s), this number would be the second coin. The algorithm would repeat until the difference between n and the sum of the value of the coins reaches zero. The algorithm is optimal because there will never be repitition of coin values as all coins are in base 2 and at each step the largest possible base 2 value is being removed.
